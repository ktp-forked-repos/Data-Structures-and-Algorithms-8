## <a name = "project1" />Project 1:

The project description is in [p1-description].

You are required to construct five sorting algorithms.

* [bubble sort]
* [insertion sort]
* [selection sort]
* [merge sort]
* [quick sort in place]
* [quick sort extra]

You can find the codes in [p1-implementation].

## <a name = "warning" />Warning:
For students who are currently taking `Ve281`, please abide by the ***Honor Code*** in case of unnecessary troubles. 

## Some Tips
Recently, someone copied my codes and was caught by the Honor Council. According to this guy, a similarity of 89% does not necessarily mean academic dishonesty, which,I have to admit, is quite refreshing and impressive. Several kind reminders for this guy: Huaiwei could not be the right company for you. Consider Tencent next time, since you love copying others' codes a lot.

By the way, it is really pathetic to get only 16/100 even by copying others' codes.

For students taking this course, frankly speaking, it is far more dangerous to copy codes under this repo than <a href="https://github.com/TianzeWang">`Tianze Wang`</a>'s. The fact is, it could be safer to copy codes from `tc-imba`'s repo since he sends someone to HC, while I send someone to hell.

Best luck.
